# Logistic_Regression_Primitivei
The primitive code of Logistic Regression.

It contains the code of how to calculate beta from maximum likelihood estimation by Newton-Raphson method.

Meanwhile, I also write the code of simulation to prove the ability of calculation and set up some arguments for users to change.

Those arguments can be used to evaluate the change of beta estimation between different set of sizes of samples and variables.

Besides, I also provide the primitive code of drawing ROC curve and calculate AUC score. Hope it can help anyone who is intersted in the code working behind Logisitc Regression.
